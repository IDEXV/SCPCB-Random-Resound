# SCPCB: Random Resound
SCPCB: Random Resound is a resound pack for SCP Containment Breach game, made by Undertow Games. This mod consists of memey, random and ear rapey sounds, made by IDEXV. Some of the sounds are illogical, same for the voices. There is no point for the mod, because it was created for a good laugh. You can still complete the game, because nothing was changed, except for the sounds.
