# SCPCB: Resound

This is a half memey, half realistic resound for SCP: Containment Breach game, made by Undertow Games (Regalis).
All the sounds are Russian, but some words are English. 

## Half of the sounds are ear rapey, so be careful when playing the game.

# How to play

**Download the release, and launch the game via `SCPCB Resound - Launcher.exe`**
